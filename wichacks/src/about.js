            Hey All! <br></br> 
            This page is about the four lovely people who created me.
         </p>
         <p>
            I was created at the Women In Computing Hackathon, WiCHacks!
         </p>

           The team that created me consists of 4 women, Emily Crilley, Kelsey Donovan, Jaime Campanelli, and Alanna Luce.
